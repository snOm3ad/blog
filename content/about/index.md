Hello, my name is Oliver ðŸ‘‹ also known as **@snOm3ad**.

I am an Industrial Engineering graduate based in Montreal with a strong passion for programming and mathematics. I like learning new stuff but also mastering things I already know as well as teaching these things to others! I made this blog because I often run into problems that, with a few added simplifications, end up being great opportunities for learning and understanding the inner workings of a concept. 

I'm currently in love with Rust ðŸ¦€ and trying to get into DevOps.

In my spare time I also tinker around in:
- Python
- Golang
- Web Stuff: JS, HTML and CSS

I don't have much of an online presence but if you want to get in touch here are my links:
